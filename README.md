# Amazon_Vine_Analysis 
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to see if there is a correlation between star rating and a vine review. we want to see that the presence of a vine review increases the star rating. 
## Results 
* There were 94 reviews with vine and 40471 reviews with no vine 
* 48 5 star reviews were vine reviews and 15663 were non vine reviews 
* About 51% of 5 star reviews were vine reviews and 39% 5 star reviews were non vine reviews 
## Summary 
I think there definitely is a correlation between the percentage of 5 star reviews and if the reviews are vine or not. In this case we see around 51 percent of 5 star reviews were from vine while only 39 percent of 5 star reviews were from non vine ones. I think another interesting thing would also see if there is negative correlation between vine or no vine reviews. This can be defined as 2 stars or lower. Conversely, I think making the positive correlation analysis 4 stars or higher would be better since most people would consider a 4 star review to also be a good movie.
